# Superheroes
## [Link to Website](https://michaelt-w23.github.io/Superheroes/)

This the static version of the [Superhero-Frontend](https://github.com/MichaelT-W23/Superhero-Frontend) website. I made this so that people could try out the website's static features without it being deployed to AWS. I replaced the Rest Api backend with JSON files and added some small new features.


## Unavailable Features
- Signing in and Out
- Adding Superheroes
- Deleting Superheroes

## New Features
- The Team counter badge
- New superheroes and powers 

## Original Demo
The [Youtube Video Demo](https://youtu.be/oiSVeGPf31E?si=rgANJYLVMZLE_ARk) of the website with the Spring Boot backend can be found by pressing that link.
